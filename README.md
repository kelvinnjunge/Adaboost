# Analysis-to-test-for-hypothyroidism

#Overview

Nairobi Hospital hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients


#Tasks
Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

Using decision trees
For this section, we are to use at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models we have studied: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.
Try and optimize each of the 2 models, making sure to document how you've set up your hyperparameters.
Identify which of the 2 models you trust most, and use your model to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the predictionUsing SVM
Evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best.
Tune your parameters to improve the performance of your model.
Visualize the models you've created. Use any two features to build the models for this step.
Repeat the prediction using additional features.
Compare the model you've just created with the 2-features version
